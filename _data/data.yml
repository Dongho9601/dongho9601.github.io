    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I completed my Ph.D. at Yonsei University, Korea (Advisor: Professor Won Woo Ro), 
      with a dissertation “GPU Architecture Design for Effective Computing Resource Usage.” 
      My expertise lies in designing computer architectures from general-purpose to domain-specific processors, focusing on optimizing computing and memory resource utilization. My recent research focuses on optimizing GPUs’ computing resource usage and democratizing various domain-specific accelerators. To broaden my expertise from microarchitecture to system-level design, I am currently working as a system architect at MangoBoost Inc. and exploring SmartNICs to enhance MangoBoost DPUs.
      - Fast learner
      - Resilient personality
