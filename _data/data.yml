    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, Korea, studying computer architecture (advisor: Won Woo Ro). 
      My research focuses on optimizing parallel processing units (e.g., GPUs and Domain-Specific Accelerators) 
      and extending their functionalities to improve diverse applications' performance, energy efficiency, and usability.
    
      Currently, I am a junior specialist at the University of California, Riverside <br>
      (advisor: Hung-Wei Tseng).
      
      I am seeking a job/postdoctoral program  in the United States with a visa support <br>
      (my expected graduation date is Aug 2024)
