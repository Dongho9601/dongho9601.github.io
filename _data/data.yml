    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I completed my Ph.D. at Yonsei University, Korea (Advisor: Professor Won Woo Ro), with a dissertation titled “GPU Architecture Design for Effective Computing Resource Usage.” My expertise spans the design of computer architectures—from general-purpose to domain-specific processors—with a focus on optimizing computing and memory resource utilization.
      My recent research has centered on improving GPU resource efficiency and democratizing domain-specific accelerators. To broaden my expertise from microarchitecture to system-level design, I worked as a system architect at MangoBoost Inc., where I explored SmartNICs to enhance MangoBoost DPUs. Currently, I am working at Meta as an ASIC engineer, further advancing my experience in cutting-edge chip design and large-scale hardware systems.
